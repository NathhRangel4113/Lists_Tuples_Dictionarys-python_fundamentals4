## Lists_Tuples_Dictionarys-python_fundamentals4
In this repository you can find 15 solved and simple exercises carried out through `<link>` : <https://replit.com/~> which are made using the Python programming language.

The exercises are taken from a document sent by the teacher.

## Main.py
In order to get started, it is important to clarify the order in which the exercises would be performed. For this, a main document "1.0_main.py" was established, in which you can find the function to execute the document with the exercise you want only taking into account the number of each one.
In this link you can find the code of the main document in detail.

`<link>` : <(https://github.com/NathhRangel4113/Lists_Tuples_Dictionarys-python_fundamentals4)>

It should be noted that the same document contains ALL the exercises that will be explained below:

## Exercises:
#### 45. Addition of elements: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and return the sum of all the elements of the list.
#### 46. Average of values: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and calculate the average of all the elements of the list.
#### 47. Dedupe: Write a function that takes a list as input and remove all duplicate items, leaving only one occurrence of each item in the final list.
#### 48. Sort List: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and order from smallest to largest. Don't use Python's built-in sort function.
#### 49. Longest Words: Write a function that takes a list of words as input and return the longest word in the list. If there are several words with the same maximum length, returns the first one that appears in the list.
#### 50. Product of elements: Write a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and return the product of all elements in the tuple.
#### 51.Greatest and least element: Write a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and return the maximum and minimum value of the tuple.
#### 52. Count Occurrences: Write a function that takes a tuple as input and counts how many times each element appears in the tuple, returning a dictionary with the elements as keys and occurrences as values.
#### 53. Find Indices: Write a function that takes a tuple and an element as input, and return a list with all the indices in which the element appears in the tuple.
#### 54. Separate elements: Write a function that takes a tuple of strings as input and return two separate tuples: one with all strings starting with a vowel and another with those that are not.
#### 55. Word Count: Write a function that takes a list of words as input and return a dictionary that counts how many times each word appears in the list.
#### 56. Calculate GPA: Write a function that takes a dictionary of students and their grades as input, and calculate the grade point average of all students
#### 57. Filter by value: Write a function that takes a dictionary and a value as input, and return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs of the original dictionary whose value is equal to the given value.
#### 58. Combine Dictionaries: Write a function that takes two dictionaries as input and combine them into one, adding the values ​​of the keys that are common in both dictionaries.
#### 59. Most frequent words: Write a function that takes a text as input and return a dictionary that counts how many times each word occurs in the text, ignoring case (case sensitive).



## Structure:
First of all we define each of the exercises proposed in the miscellaneous of exercises, then below we can find the structure of the code that will allow us to execute each one of them according to the choice of the end user.

## Defining
In the definition we can find each of the exercises (including the previous ones) already defined as a function to be used later, specifically we can see a function of each exercise and the code of each one under the comment with the number.

## Running
In the executing section we can find a simple code that allows us to execute each of the exercises defined as functions previously, this allows us to have a continuous visualization of the exercises without the need to re-execute, since it has a "While" cycle system "that allows us to have this facility. Additionally, the program will end when the number 99 is entered.

Thank you very much for checking out my repository <3
