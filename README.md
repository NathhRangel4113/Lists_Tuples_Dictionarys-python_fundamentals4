## Lists_Tuples_Dictionarys-python_fundamentals4
In this repository you can find 15 solved and simple exercises carried out through `<link>` : <https://replit.com/~> which are made using the Python programming language.

The exercises are taken from a document sent by the teacher.

## Main.py
In order to get started, it is important to clarify the order in which the exercises would be performed. For this, a main document "1.0_main.py" was established, in which you can find the function to execute the document with the exercise you want only taking into account the number of each one.
In this link you can find the code of the main document in detail.

`<link>` : <(https://github.com/NathhRangel4113/Cycles-Python-Fundamentals-3/blob/main/main.py)>

It should be noted that the same document contains ALL the exercises that will be explained below:

## Exercises:
#### 30. Print all the multiples of 3 that are between 1 and 100.

## Structure:
First of all we define each of the exercises proposed in the miscellaneous of exercises, then below we can find the structure of the code that will allow us to execute each one of them according to the choice of the end user.

## Defining
In the definition we can find each of the exercises (including the previous ones) already defined as a function to be used later, specifically we can see a function of each exercise and the code of each one under the comment with the number.

## Running
In the executing section we can find a simple code that allows us to execute each of the exercises defined as functions previously, this allows us to have a continuous visualization of the exercises without the need to re-execute, since it has a "While" cycle system "that allows us to have this facility. Additionally, the program will end when the number 99 is entered.

Thank you very much for checking out my repository <3
